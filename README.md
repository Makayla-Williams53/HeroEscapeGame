HeroEscapeGame

## Final for AP Computer Science A

This is a console log game made in InteliJ for my high school Computer Science A class. I was required to make
a project using realtional and logical operators, if else statments, loops, and parent and child classes. I chose
to do this in the form of a game in the console log that uses user input in order to determien the story and whether
or not the fictional main character escapes the dungeon.

Requirements:
1) At least two relational and two logical operators
2) At least two "if-then-else" statements
3) At least two of the following: for loop, for-each loop, and while loop
4) At least one parent class and three child classes
5) Interaction between all clases and interfaces
6) Use of an array list or array
7) Must show a high level of "algorithmic complexity"
8) Comments that explain the logic and operation of the program
9) Meaningful variable and class names
10) includes comments for each method
11) follow the Rioux-Style requirements
