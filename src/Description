Description: 
My game is a combination of choose your own adventure and a pokemon fight scene. It tells the story of a brave yet mischievous hero to which the user gets to name, 
and how they are being held captive by their archnemesis, Jorgan the Chaotic. The hero must fight Jorgan in order to escape, the user must select which move the 
hero will do next, they can attack, run, or use a potion. How much damage each attack does is totally randomized but with a good fight strategy our hero, with the 
help of the user, can escape the prison holding him hostage. 

How to play:
In the console enter the information to answer that specific prompt, enter a number or a name etc. the type of information that the game requires will be specified 
throughout the story.

Interesting Features:
1.  How much damage each of the attacks does is totally randomized using the Random java class. Then through a series of if statements it determines the value and 
assigns a certain number of damage points to it. For example if the random number is 65 then the hero will do 15 points of damage.
2. The information regarding the villain, Jorgan, is totally random and there are lots of combinations. The two things that change are what weapon he carries, what 
villainous quote he says during the battle. This was done by using a random number from the Random java class then having that select a certain position from the arrays
that hold the options for weapons and quotes.
